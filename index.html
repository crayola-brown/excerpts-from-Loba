		<h1>Hooooowwwwll</h1>
		<h2>Excerpts from "Loba" by Diane di Prima</h2>
that she is eternal, that she sings<br>
that she is star-born, that she gathers<br>crystal<br>
that she can be confused with Isis<br>
that she is the goal<br>
that she knows her name, that she swims<br>
in the purple sky, that her fingers are pale & strong<br>

that she is black, that she is white<br>
that you always know who she is<br>
when she appears<br>
that she strides on battlements, that she sifts<br>
like stones in the sea<br>
that you can hear her approach, that her jewelled feet<br>
tread any particular measure<br>

that there is anything about her
which cannot be said<br>
that she relishes tombstones, falls
down marble stairs<br>
that she is ground only, that she is not ground<br>
that you can remember the first time you met<br>
that she is always with you<br>
that she can be seen without grace<br>

that there is anything to say of her<br>
which is not truth<br></br>

LILITH OF THE STARS<br></br>

for there is another Lilith, not made for earth<br>
of whom it is said / that when she is seen by men<br>
it is as vapour / a plague / a cacophony
of unique bells / straining & stranger, they pursue<br>
her unsubstantial cors thru this world
& the next. She is, in fact, the archetypal
foxfire of the stars<br>
will o'the wisp of empty space
cosmic marshlight that lures us away<br>
from the heavenly spheres, our home<br>
to wander, forever, between quasars<br>
at odds w/ the Sound of the Harmonious Crystals<br></br>

temple flower of the abyss<br></br>

                 windlass<br>
                 on which is wound<br>
                 that hope<br>
                 which exceeds proportion.<br></br>
